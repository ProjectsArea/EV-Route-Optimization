âš¡ EV Route Optimization App

An intelligent Electric Vehicle (EV) Route Planner that helps users find the best driving route with optimal charging stops based on the vehicleâ€™s battery percentage and range capacity.
This app integrates real-time routing APIs with charging station data and visualizes everything on an interactive map with a professional interface.
